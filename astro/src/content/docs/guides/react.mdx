## Installation & Setup

ðŸš§ This library is under development and not for production (yet)!! ðŸš§

In your project, add the `@abc-editor/react` package and the `abcjs` rendering library as dependencies:

```bash
npm install abcjs @abc-editor/react@alpha
# or yarn add, pnpm install, etc...
```

If you're using the editor with the built-in toolbar, you'll also need the CSS file located at `/dist/style.css` within the `@abc-editor/react` package. How to include the CSS file depends on the build tool that you're using. If you're using a bundler like Vite or Parcel, you can just import the CSS file:

```js
import "@abc-editor/react/dist/style.css";
```

## Basic Editor

This shows a basic setup of the interactive notation editor, using the `ABCEditor` component with the built-in toolbar. We can use the component's `onChange` handler to update the [ABC notation](https://abcnotation.com/) in the text field below, as the user writes their melody. [Keyboard shortcuts](../../reference/keyboard-shortcuts) are also enabled in the editor props.

<div class="not-content">
  <BasicEditor client:idle />
</div>

### Code

<Code code={BasicEditorCode} lang="tsx" />

## Exercise

This demonstrates how to setup a simple exercise/game using the notation editor. When the user successfully enters the notes of a one-octave G Major scale, the notes turn green and celebrations ensue. Notice we are making use of one of the [handy CSS classes](https://paulrosen.github.io/abcjs/visual/classes.html) from the abcjs rendering library, in order to select the note elements. Also notice we need to wrap the `onChange` callback in a `useCallback` hook in order to avoid infinite re-renders.

**Write a G Major scale using quarter notes, starting from G above middle C:**

<div class="not-content">
  <Exercise client:visible />
</div>

### Code

<Code code={ExerciseCode} lang="tsx" />
