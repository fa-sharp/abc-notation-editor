import { Code } from "astro:components";
import BasicEditor from "../../../components/ReactBasicEditor";
import BasicEditorCode from "../../../components/ReactBasicEditor?raw";

## Installation & Setup

In your project, add the `@abc-editor/react` package and the `abcjs` rendering library as dependencies:

```bash
npm install abcjs @abc-editor/react@alpha
# or yarn add, pnpm install, etc...
```

If you're using the editor with the built-in toolbar, you'll also need the CSS file located at `/dist/style.css` within the `@abc-editor/react` package. How to include the CSS file depends on the build tool that you're using. If you're using a bundler like Vite or Parcel, you can just import the CSS file:

```js
import "@abc-editor/react/dist/style.css";
```

## Basic Editor

This shows a basic setup of the interactive notation editor, using the `ABCEditor` component with the built-in toolbar. We can hook into this component's `onChange` handler to update the [ABC notation](https://abcnotation.com/) in the text field below, as the user writes their melody:

<div class="not-content">
  <BasicEditor client:idle width={800} />
</div>

### Code

<Code code={BasicEditorCode} lang="tsx" />
